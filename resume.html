                  <h6>2014</h6>
                  <p>
                    At a major online e-commerce company where my duties included answering and directing, incoming calls, emails, and text messages in reference to customer's online orders and accounts from multiple diffrent e-commerce websites.
                    Solving customer issues within company established guidelines when possible or, escalating them to the next tier of service. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The team and I were experiencing problems finding and retrieving information to help our customers in a timeley efficient manner.
                  Team members would come to me for the answers to their questions, when supervisors were not availble.
                  As a result, I was helping team members more than customers.
                  I then decided to build and distribute a tool to overlay the company sharepoints and provide such vital information to employees and in turn customers.
                  This led to shorter call times, more customers being serviced, and powerfull, confident employees.
                  By the end of season I was offered a permanent position and scholoarship opertunities.
